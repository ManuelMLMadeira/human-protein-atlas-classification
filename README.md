# Human Protein Atlas Image Classification ([Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification))

We developed this project in the context of the Machine Learning course at Tsinghua University.

This project aimed to solve a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification), whose main target was to classify subcellular protein patterns in human cells from microscopy imaging samples using Deep Neural Networks.

For a guided tour throughout our approach, please consult the **final_report.pdf**.
